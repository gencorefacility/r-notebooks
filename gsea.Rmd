This R Notebook describes the implementation of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the clusterProfiler package. For more information please see the full documentation here: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/clusterProfiler/inst/doc/clusterProfiler.html


# Install and load required packages
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
#BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler", version = "3.8")
#BiocManager::install("pathview")
#BiocManager::install("enrichplot")
library(clusterProfiler)
library(enrichplot)
# we use ggplot2 to add x axis labels (ex: ridgeplot)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Annotations
I'm using *D melanogaster* data, so I install and load the annotation "org.Dm.eg.db" below. See all annotations available here: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___OrgDb (there are 19 presently available). 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# SET THE DESIRED ORGANISM HERE
organism = "org.Dm.eg.db"
#BiocManager::install(organism, character.only = TRUE)
library(organism, character.only = TRUE)
```

#Prepare Input
```{r}
# reading in data from deseq2
df = read.csv("drosphila_example_de.csv", header=TRUE)

# we want the log2 fold change 
original_gene_list <- df$log2FoldChange

# name the vector
names(original_gene_list) <- df$X

# omit any NA values 
gene_list<-na.omit(original_gene_list)

# sort the list in decreasing order (required for clusterProfiler)
gene_list = sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)
```

## Gene Set Enrichment
Params:  
  
**keyType** This is the source of the annotation (gene ids). The options vary for each annotation. In the example of *org.Dm.eg.db*, the options are:   
  
"ACCNUM"       "ALIAS"        "ENSEMBL"      "ENSEMBLPROT"  "ENSEMBLTRANS" "ENTREZID"      
"ENZYME"       "EVIDENCE"     "EVIDENCEALL"  "FLYBASE"      "FLYBASECG"    "FLYBASEPROT"   
"GENENAME"     "GO"           "GOALL"        "MAP"          "ONTOLOGY"     "ONTOLOGYALL"   
"PATH"         "PMID"         "REFSEQ"       "SYMBOL"       "UNIGENE"      "UNIPROT"  
  
Check which options are available with the `keytypes` command, for example `keytypes(org.Dm.eg.db)`. 
  
**ont** one of "BP", "MF", "CC" or "ALL"  
**nPerm** permutation numbers, the higher the number of permutations you set, the more accurate your results is, but it will also cost longer time for running permutation.  
**minGSSize** minimal size of each geneSet for analyzing.   
**maxGSSize** maximal size of genes annotated for testing.   
**pvalueCutoff** pvalue Cutoff.   
**pAdjustMethod** one of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none" 

```{r}
gse <- gseGO(geneList=gene_list, 
             ont ="ALL", 
             keyType = "ENSEMBL", 
             nPerm = 10000, 
             minGSSize = 3, 
             maxGSSize = 800, 
             pvalueCutoff = 0.05, 
             verbose = TRUE, 
             OrgDb = organism, 
             pAdjustMethod = "none")
```

# Output
##Table of results
```{r}
head(gse)
```

##Dotplot
```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=15, fig.height=8}
require(DOSE)
dotplot(gse, showCategory=10, split=".sign") + facet_grid(.~.sign)
```

##Encrichment plot map:
Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to cluster together, making it easy to identify functional modules.
```{r echo=TRUE}
emapplot(gse, showCategory = 10)

```

##Category Netplot
The cnetplot depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network (helpful to see which genes are involved in enriched pathways and genes that may belong to multiple annotation categories).
```{r fig.width=18}
# categorySize can be either 'pvalue' or 'geneNum'
cnetplot(gse, categorySize="pvalue", foldChange=gene_list, showCategory = 3)
```

## Ridgeplot
Helpful to interpret up/down-regulated pathways.
```{r fig.width=18, fig.height=12}

ridgeplot(gse) + labs(x = "enrichment distribution")
```

## GSEA Plot  
Traditional method for visualizing GSEA result.  
  
Params:  
**Gene Set** Integer. Corresponds to gene set in the gse object. The first gene set is 1, second gene set is 2, etc. 

```{r fig.height=6}
# Use the `Gene Set` param for the index in the title, and as the value for geneSetId
gseaplot(gse, by = "all", title = gse$Description[1], geneSetID = 1)
```

## PubMed trend of enriched terms
Plots the number/proportion of publications trend based on the query result from PubMed Central.
```{r fig.width=10}
terms <- gse$Description[1:3]
pmcplot(terms, 2010:2018, proportion=FALSE)
```


# KEGG Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
For KEGG pathway enrichment using the `gseKEGG()` function, we need to convert id types. We can use the `bitr` function for this (included in clusterProfiler). It is normal for this call to produce some messages / warnings. 

In the `bitr` function, the param `fromType` should be the same as `keyType` from the `gseGO` function above (the annotation source). This param is used again in the next two steps: creating `dedup_ids` and `df2`.  

`toType` in the `bitr` function has to be one of the available options from `keyTypes(org.Dm.eg.db)` and must map to one of 'kegg', 'ncbi-geneid', 'ncib-proteinid' or 'uniprot' because `gseKEGG()` only accepts one of these 4 options as it's `keytype` parameter. In the case of org.Dm.eg.db, none of those 4 types are available, but 'ENTREZID' are the same as ncbi-geneid for org.Dm.eg.db so we use this for `toType`. 

As our intial input, we use `original_gene_list` which we created above.

## Prepare Input
```{r}
# Convert gene IDs for gseKEGG function
# We will lose some genes here because not all IDs will be converted
ids<-bitr(names(original_gene_list), fromType = "ENSEMBL", toType = "ENTREZID", OrgDb=organism)

# remove duplicate IDS (here I use "ENSEMBL", but it should be whatever was selected as keyType)
dedup_ids = ids[!duplicated(ids[c("ENSEMBL")]),]

# Create a new dataframe df2 which has only the genes which were successfully mapped using the bitr function above
df2 = df[df$X %in% dedup_ids$ENSEMBL,]

# Create a new column in df2 with the corresponding ENTREZ IDs
df2$Y = dedup_ids$ENTREZID

# Create a vector of the gene unuiverse
kegg_gene_list <- df2$log2FoldChange

# Name vector with ENTREZ ids
names(kegg_gene_list) <- df2$Y

# omit any NA values 
kegg_gene_list<-na.omit(kegg_gene_list)

# sort the list in decreasing order (required for clusterProfiler)
kegg_gene_list = sort(kegg_gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)

```
## Create gseKEGG object
 
**organism** KEGG Organism Code: The full list is here: https://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html (need the 3 letter code). I define this as `kegg_organism` first, because it is used again below when making the pathview plots.  
**nPerm** permutation numbers, the higher the number of permutations you set, the more accurate your results is, but it will also cost longer time for running permutation.  
**minGSSize** minimal size of each geneSet for analyzing.   
**maxGSSize** maximal size of genes annotated for testing.   
**pvalueCutoff** pvalue Cutoff.   
**pAdjustMethod** one of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none".  
**keyType** one of 'kegg', 'ncbi-geneid', 'ncib-proteinid' or 'uniprot'.  
```{r}
kegg_organism = "dme"
kk2 <- gseKEGG(geneList     = kegg_gene_list,
               organism     = kegg_organism,
               nPerm        = 10000,
               minGSSize    = 3,
               maxGSSize    = 800,
               pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
               pAdjustMethod = "none",
               keyType       = "ncbi-geneid")
```

```{r}
head(kk2, 10)
```

## Dotplot
```{r echo=TRUE}
dotplot(kk2, showCategory = 10, title = "Enriched Pathways" , split=".sign") + facet_grid(.~.sign)
```

## Encrichment plot map:
Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to cluster together, making it easy to identify functional modules.
```{r echo=TRUE}
 emapplot(kk2)
```

## Category Netplot:
The cnetplot depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network (helpful to see which genes are involved in enriched pathways and genes that may belong to multiple annotation categories).
```{r fig.width=12}
# categorySize can be either 'pvalue' or 'geneNum'
cnetplot(kk2, categorySize="pvalue", foldChange=gene_list)
```

## Ridgeplot
Helpful to interpret up/down-regulated pathways.
```{r fig.width=18, fig.height=12}
ridgeplot(kk2) + labs(x = "enrichment distribution")
```

# GSEA Plot  
Traditional method for visualizing GSEA result.  
  
Params:  
**Gene Set** Integer. Corresponds to gene set in the gse object. The first gene set is 1, second gene set is 2, etc. Default: 1  

```{r fig.height=6}
# Use the `Gene Set` param for the index in the title, and as the value for geneSetId
gseaplot(kk2, by = "all", title = kk2$Description[1], geneSetID = 1)
```

#Pathview
This will create a PNG and *different* PDF of the enriched KEGG pathway.  
  
Params:  
**gene.data** This is `kegg_gene_list` created above  
**pathway.id** The user needs to enter this. Enriched pathways + the pathway ID are provided in the gseKEGG output table (above).  
**species** Same as `organism` above in `gseKEGG`, which we defined as `kegg_organism`

```{r, message=F, warning=F, echo = TRUE}
library(pathview)

# Produce the native KEGG plot (PNG)
dme <- pathview(gene.data=kegg_gene_list, pathway.id="dme04130", species = kegg_organism)

# Produce a different plot (PDF) (not displayed here)
dme <- pathview(gene.data=kegg_gene_list, pathway.id="dme04130", species = kegg_organism, kegg.native = F)
```
```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="KEGG Native Enriched Pathway Plot", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("dme04130.pathview.png")
```
